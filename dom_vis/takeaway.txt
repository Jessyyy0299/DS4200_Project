For interactive:

The interactive visualization allows users to explore different features of high-scoring red and white wines through a stacked bar chart. Users can observe the proportions of 'Low', 'Medium', and 'High' levels for each feature separately for red and white wines. The features (e.g., alcohol, pH) can be selected through a dropdown, with the 'Low', 'Medium', 'High' levels determined by 0-33%, 33-66%, and 66-100% quantiles.

Interactions include: a dropdown to select features, a quality slider to filter by wine quality, and a toggle button to show/hide the slider. These interactions make it easy to explore the data and uncover how different features contribute to the quality of red and white wines.


For static:
The static visualization presents regression line slopes for each wine category, which is defined by combinations of alcohol, pH, and acidity levels. Each bar represents the slope of the regression line for sulphates vs. quality, indicating whether sulphates have a positive or negative impact on quality for that category.

The chart helps users quickly identify which wine combinations benefit from increased sulphates and which are negatively affected. The zero line highlights positive versus negative effects, making it a valuable tool for winemakers to optimize wine characteristics.
