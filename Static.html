            </div>
            <p>The heatmaps reveal that the interaction between volatile acidity and residual sugar levels influences wine quality. For red wine, the highest quality is achieved when the volatile acidity is in the range of 0.6-0.9, paired with residual sugar levels below 6 g/L (Dry). High volatile acidity beyond 1.4 appears detrimental to quality, likely due to spoilage. For white wine, the highest quality occurs when the volatile acidity is also in the range of 0.6-0.9, but residual sugar levels exceeding 35 g/L (Sweet) are associated with better quality. These insights suggest that producers aiming for higher-quality red wine should prioritize maintaining volatile acidity within the optimal range while ensuring the wine remains dry. For white wine, balancing volatile acidity with higher residual sugar levels could improve quality. Additionally, volatile acidity exceeding legal thresholds correlates with poor quality in both types of wine, emphasizing the importance of strict control during fermentation.

            <h2>Covariance Analysis</h2>

            <section class="content-box">
                <p>The covariance plot compares variability in wine quality between red and white wines based on three feature ratios:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Fixed Acidity Ratio</b>: Red wines show greater variability in quality at medium-to-high ratios (0.6–0.8), with fluctuating quality levels despite similar acidity compositions. In contrast, white wines are more consistent, with high-quality samples clustering at specific ratios.</li>
                    <li><b>Free Sulfur Dioxide Ratio</b>: White wines display tighter clustering at medium ratios (0.4–0.6), corresponding to higher quality, while red wines exhibit significant scattering across low-to-medium ratios, indicating less predictable impacts of SO₂ balance on quality.</li>
                    <li><b>Alcohol-Sulfur Dioxide Ratio</b>: Red wines demonstrate higher variability at low ratios (0.1–0.3), with samples spanning multiple quality levels. White wines are more consistent, with high-quality samples concentrated in the medium-to-high ratio range (0.5–0.7).</li>
                </ol>
                <p>These findings suggest that red wines are more sensitive to changes in these feature ratios, requiring stricter control over chemical balances to achieve consistent quality. In contrast, white wines show greater stability, with specific ratio ranges reliably linked to higher quality.</p>
