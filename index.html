                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The first objective of our project is to analyze the various attributes of wine that influence its quality, such as acidity, alcohol content, and other measurable chemical properties. Wine quality is often a subjective measure, but by focusing on objective data, we would like to uncover which factors most significantly impact the overall evaluation of wine. This analysis will help us understand the underlying science of what makes a wine "good" from a quality standpoint. By identifying these key attributes, we can offer valuable insights to winemakers who want to refine their production processes, as well as consumers looking to make more informed choices.</p>
                <p>The second aim of our project is to explore and compare the key differences between red and white wines. While both types of wine share common characteristics, they differ significantly in their composition, flavor profiles, and the factors that determine their quality. By examining red and white wine separately, we aim to highlight the unique attributes that define each type, as well as how those attributes interact to affect the overall quality. This comparison will provide a more nuanced understanding of the distinctions between these two popular types of wine, offering insights into why certain wines appeal to different preferences and occasions.</p>

                <h2>Dataset</h2>
                <p><a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality" target="_blank">Dataset for this analysis</a> combines two files: one containing wine quality data for red wine and the other for white wine. The red wine dataset includes "1,599 records", and the white wine dataset contains "4,898 records", resulting in a combined total of "6,497 entries". <a href="dom_vis/combined_wine_quality.csv">Both datasets</a> share 12 original attributes, including physicochemical properties such as "volatile acidity", "residual sugar", "alcohol content", and "pH", along with a "quality rating" on a scale from 0 to 10. During data preparation, we added many derived columns such as "volatile_acidity_group" and "residual_sugar_group", which categorize continuous variables into meaningful ranges to facilitate trend analysis. Data cleaning included creating these categories, ensuring consistency, and removing duplicates. While the dataset provides valuable insights into the relationship between wine characteristics and quality, it lacks additional details like "grape variety", "region of production", and "specific fermentation techniques", which could offer a more nuanced understanding of wine quality.</p>

                    <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/B012227055X012992" target="_blank">Wine tasting</a>, this reference talks about a sensory-based rating system and explains that evaluating wine quality can actually be objective. Since our dataset includes a "quality" attribute, the criteria mentioned in the essay are relevant and closely linked to what we have. It also shows how things like acidity and alcohol levels can impact the quality, and the scoring system uses different weightings, which we can refer to in our analysis.
