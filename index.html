    <div class="interpretation">
        <strong>Covariance Analysis Interpretation:</strong>
        This analysis visualizes the covariance scores of different quality indicators for both red and white wines. Each group represents a distinct quality indicator (such as <em>fixed acidity</em>, <em>free sulfur dioxide</em>, or <em>alcohol level</em>). Within each group, the chart compares the <em>low</em>, <em>medium</em>, and <em>high</em> categories for red and white wines.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Insight:</strong> Higher covariance values for red wines in categories such as <em>fixed acidity_ratio</em> suggest a stronger association between these factors and wine quality. White wines, in contrast, tend to show higher covariance in <em>free sulfur dioxide_ratio</em>, indicating that sulfur compounds may impact white wine quality differently. These results suggest that red and white wines are influenced by quality factors in unique ways.

    <!-- Interpretation for Sustainability Analysis - Alcohol -->
    <div class="interpretation">
        <strong>Sustainability Analysis - Alcohol Interpretation:</strong>
        This analysis explores the relationship between alcohol content and various sustainability factors in red and white wines. The visualization examines the differences in how alcohol content relates to other quality indicators for each wine type.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Insight:</strong> Red wines with higher alcohol content tend to show distinct patterns in their sustainability attributes compared to white wines. For instance, higher levels of alcohol are more commonly associated with specific acidity attributes in red wine, while in white wine, they may correlate with different factors such as sulfur dioxide levels. This highlights how alcohol content impacts red and white wine sustainability in varied ways.

    <!-- Interpretation for Sustainability Analysis - Sulphates -->
    <div class="interpretation">
        <strong>Sustainability Analysis - Sulphates Interpretation:</strong>
        This section delves into the relationship between sulfate levels and various quality and sustainability indicators in red and white wines. Sulfates are a crucial factor affecting wine preservation and taste, and their effect can vary based on wine type.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Insight:</strong> The analysis reveals that red wines with higher sulfate levels often correlate with specific acidity attributes, potentially enhancing their preservation. White wines, however, may respond differently to sulfate levels, which can affect other factors like sugar content or sulfur dioxide presence. These variations underscore the distinct ways that sulfates contribute to the sustainability and quality profile of red versus white wines.
