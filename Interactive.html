                <h2>Which Properties Should Producers Prioritize to Maintain High Quality for Red and White Wines under High Sustainability Condition (Low Alcohol and Sulphate Condition)</h2>
                <p>When aiming for sustainability by reducing alcohol and sulphates, red and white wines rely on both shared and distinct attributes to maintain high quality.</p>
                <p>For <b>both red and white wines</b>, <b>pH</b> and <b>free sulfur dioxide (SO₂)</b> are critical:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>pH</b> ensures stability and balance, supporting color and tannins in reds, while maintaining freshness in whites.</li>
                    <li><b>Free SO₂</b> prevents oxidation and preserves quality across both types, especially important when sulphates are minimized.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>However, the third prioritized attribute differs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Red wines</b> benefit from <b>density</b>, which compensates for reduced alcohol by enhancing body and richness, key to their perceived quality.</li>
                    <li><b>White wines</b> rely on <b>residual sugar</b>, which balances acidity and adds complexity, making up for reduced alcohol levels.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In summary, while <b>pH</b> and <b>free SO₂</b> are essential for both, producers should focus on <b>density</b> for reds and <b>residual sugar</b> for whites to optimize quality sustainably.</p>
